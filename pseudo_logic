initial strategy:
-infer from command line argument the url
    - that would be $MIRROR_URL + "Contents-" + $ARCH + ".gz"
-gunzip that .gz
    - discard the .gz upon sucessfull completion of extraction
    - if possible grab the name of the extracted file here, safer than inferring.
-begin parsing the file with the name as extracted above (if need to infer it appears to be: "Contents-$ARCH"
-the file strcuture appears to be:
 Column1 [tab] Column2
where column1 is unique as confirmed here:

> wc -l Contents-amd64
 5146991 Contents-amd64

> cat Contents-amd64 | cut -f 1 | uniq | wc -l
 5146991

for the purposes of this exercise the contents of colum1 are irrelevant

Column2 is fomatted as a comma separated list of: OPTIONAL_ITEM/OPTIONAL_ITEM/PACKAGE_NAME
If only one PACKAGE provides the contents of column1 only one item in the list, if multiple packages could provide the column1 file, a comma separated list is created
therefore PACKAGE_NAME should be extracted and tabulated. Each instance of PACKAGE_NAME can be assumed to mean, it provides a file.
